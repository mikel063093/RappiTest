- **View** is a layer that displays data and reacts to user actions. On Android, this could be an Activity, a Fragment, an android.view.View or a Dialog.
- **Model** is a data access layer such as database API or remote server API.
- **Presenter** is a layer that provides View with data from Model. Presenter also handles background tasks.
